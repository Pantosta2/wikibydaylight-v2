    "aboutText": "Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer (4 vs 1) horror game where one player takes on the role of a ruthless Killer, and the other four play as Survivors. The goal is simple: Survivors must try to escape the Killer, avoiding being caught, tortured, and killed. To do this, they must repair five generators spread across the map to power the exit gates and escape.",
    "survivorTitle": "The Survivor's Role",
    "survivorText": "As a Survivor, your main objective is cooperation and stealth. You must work with the other three survivors to repair the generators and escape. Survival can depend on collaborative or selfish decisions. Every choice counts, and the procedurally generated environment changes in each match, so you'll never feel completely safe.",

    "killerText": "As a Killer, your mission is to hunt, capture, and sacrifice the Survivors for a malevolent force known as 'The Entity.' Each Killer, from a powerful slasher to terrifying paranormal entities, possesses a unique power. Mastering this power, along with the game's mechanics, is key to victory.",
    "killerPoints": {
      "point1": "Hunt the Survivors: Patrol generators, look for scratch marks, and listen for sounds to find your prey.",
      "point2": "Use your unique power: Each killer has special abilities, such as traps, invisibility, or ranged attacks, that define their playstyle.",
      "point3": "Sacrifice: Hook survivors to sacrifice them to The Entity and eliminate them from the match.",
